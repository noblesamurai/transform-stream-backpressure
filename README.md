`check()` function.

## Usage

```js
const fs = require('fs');

function check () {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(500, resolve);
  });
}

const readable = fs.createReadStream('myfile');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('other');

const transform = require('transform-stream-backpressure')(myfunc, { objectMode: true, highWaterMark: 20 });
readable.pipe(transform).pipe(writable);

```
